# Frontend Developer Assignment

## Overview

This assignment involves creating a responsive web application based on the provided designs for both desktop and mobile views. The application should implement the specified functionality and store data in the browser’s local storage.

---

## Design Requirements

* Implement the UI according to the provided designs:

  * **Desktop:** (Adobe XD link)
  * **Mobile:** (Adobe XD link)
* Ensure the UI is fully responsive and adapts smoothly between desktop and mobile layouts.
* Pay attention to details such as spacing, typography, and color schemes as shown in the XD designs.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Data Storage

* Store all application data in the browser’s **local storage**.
* Implement data persistence across page reloads.
* Since there are no form elements, store data in objects within local storage.

### 2. User Interaction

* Implement all interactive elements as shown in the XD designs.
* Ensure smooth transitions and animations where applicable.

### 3. Responsive Behavior

* The application should adapt seamlessly between desktop and mobile views.
* Implement any necessary layout changes or element repositioning for different screen sizes.

### 4. Performance

* Optimize the application for fast loading and smooth performance.
* Implement **lazy loading** for images and other heavy assets if necessary.
